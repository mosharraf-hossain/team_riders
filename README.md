# Introduction:

Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) technology is a machine learning framework inspired by the human neocortex's structure and function.
It emulates the brain's ability to learn, recognize patterns, and make predictions from sensory data. HTM models the neocortex with layers
of neurons arranged hierarchically, processing information in a sequence and learning temporal patterns dynamically. Key components include 
spatial pooling, which creates sparse distributed representations of input data, and temporal memory, enabling learning sequences of patterns over time. 
HTM systems use these learned models for real-time inference, making predictions, and detecting anomalies in streaming data. 
Its applications span anomaly detection, time-series prediction, natural language processing, and sensor data analysis. 
With continuous learning capabilities, HTM adapts to changing environments and dynamic datasets effectively. 
As a result, it offers promising avenues for understanding intelligence and building intelligent systems. 
Ongoing research in neuroscience and machine learning fuels HTM's evolution, 
driving advancements in artificial intelligence and cognitive computing. 

Our project would therefore use the NeoCortex API's multisequencelearning class to implement an anomaly detection system. Specifically, 
we train our HTM Engine by reading numerical sequences from multiple JSON files inside a folder, then use the trained engine to identify patterns and identify anomalies.

# Required tools for the project:

To run this project, we need:

.NET 8.0 SDK
Nuget package: NeoCortexApi Version= 1.1.4
For code debugging, we are using IDE Visual Studio Community 2022.

# Usage:
to run this project, WE need to follow the following steps:

1. Install .NET SDK. 
2. Then use code editor/IDE of your choice Such as Visual Studio Community 2022 or Visual Studio Code.
3. Create a new console project and place all the C# codes inside your project folder.
4. Add/reference Nuget package NeoCortexApi v1.1.4 to this project.
5. Place numerical sequence JSON Files (datasets) under relevant folders respectively. All the folders should be inside the project folder.

Our project is based on NeoCortex API. 

# Details of the project: 
Our HTM Engine has been trained using the MultiSequenceLearning class in the NeoCortex API. The first step in training the HTM Engine will be 
reading and utilizing data from our training (learning) and predicting (predictive) folders, which are both present as numerical sequences in 
JSON files in the "predicting" and "training" folders inside the project directory. 

# Data format:
For this project, we used real-time data from Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB). We have taken the tweet count of Google per hour as numerical sequences, 
which are stored inside the JSON files. Example of a JSON file within the training and predicting folder.

According to the dataset, we used a total of 32 hours (16 hours for training and 16 hours for predicting) of data where the beginning time was 01.03.2015 at 12 am and the end time was 01.03.2015 at 4 pm for training data and also the beginning time was 02.03.2015 at 12 am and the end time was 02.03.2015 at 4 pm for predicting data. 



Below we give our data sequences where the sequences are in JSON files. We keep our dataset in two individual folders which are training_files (for training data where 4 files) and predicting_files (for predicting data where also 4 files).  

For example, an hourly sequence has a list of 12 numerical values per hour: [14, 14, 9, 13, 7, 7, 5, 13, 11, 7, 9, 9]. Our JSON structure is like the data given below:

```json

{
  "sequences": [
    [13, 16, 9, 5,10, 7, 5, 9, 13, 14, 9, 8],
    [12, 4, 11, 11, 11, 18, 6, 5, 8, 9, 5, 15],
    [13, 6, 14, 7, 1, 8, 9, 5, 6, 10, 6, 6],
    [10, 16, 8, 9, 5, 16, 6, 10, 11, 6,  16, 14]
  ]
}
```


# Encoding Process:
Our input data must be encoded so that our HTM Engine can process it.

We are using the following settings because we will be training and testing data that falls between the range of integer values 
between 0-100 without any periodicity. Since we only expect values to fall within this range, the minimum and maximum values 
are set to 0 and 100, respectively. It is necessary to modify these values in other use cases.
```csharp

            int inputBits = 121;
            int numColumns = 1210;
            ---------------------
            ---------------------
            double max = 100;


             Dictionary<string, object> settings = new Dictionary<string, object>()
               {
                   { "W", 21},
                   { "N", inputBits},
                   { "Radius", -1.0},
                   { "MinVal", 0.0},
                   { "Periodic", false},
                   { "Name", "integer"},
                   { "ClipInput", false},
                   { "MaxVal", max}
               };
```
# HTM Configuration:

```csharp
  public Predictor Run(Dictionary<string, List<double>> sequences)
 {

     Console.WriteLine($"Hello NeocortexApi! Experiment {nameof(MultiSequenceLearning)}");
     
     int inputBits = 121;
     int numColumns = 1210;

     HtmConfig cfg = new HtmConfig(new int[] { inputBits }, new int[] { numColumns })
     {
         Random = new ThreadSafeRandom(42),

         CellsPerColumn = 21,
         GlobalInhibition = true,
         LocalAreaDensity = -1,
         NumActiveColumnsPerInhArea = 0.02 * numColumns,
         PotentialRadius = (int)(0.15 * inputBits),
         //InhibitionRadius = 15,

         MaxBoost = 10.0,
         DutyCyclePeriod = 25,
         MinPctOverlapDutyCycles = 0.75,
         MaxSynapsesPerSegment = (int)(0.02 * numColumns),

         ActivationThreshold = 15,
         ConnectedPermanence = 0.5,

         // Learning is slower than forgetting in this case.
         PermanenceDecrement = 0.25,
         PermanenceIncrement = 0.15,

         // Used by punishing of segments.
         PredictedSegmentDecrement = 0.1
     };

     double max = 100;

     Dictionary<string, object> settings = new Dictionary<string, object>()
     {
         { "W", 21},
         { "N", inputBits},
         { "Radius", -1.0},
         { "MinVal", 0.0},
         { "Periodic", false},
         { "Name", "integer"},
         { "ClipInput", false},
         { "MaxVal", max}
     };

     EncoderBase encoder = new ScalarEncoder(settings);

     return RunExperiment(inputBits, cfg, encoder, sequences);
 }
```
#  Execution Process of the project

We carry out our project in the manner described below:

In our project, we keep all the JSON files inside the folder `training_files` and `predicting_files`. We have used JSON format over other formats like CSV or XML because it can handle complex and large amounts of data.

We use (jsonfileread) to read the json files from the folders.

````csharp
public JsonFolderReader(string folderPath)
    {
        AllSequences = new List<SequencesContainer>();

        // Get all JSON files in the specified folder
        string[] jsonFiles = Directory.GetFiles(folderPath, "*.json");
.......

````

We extract the numerical sequences from JSON files present inside both the training and predicting folders, and use it to train HTM model using multisequencelearning class. Later, data extracted from predicting folder is used for anomaly detection. Sequences from the training and predicting folder will used for training our model while the predicting folder will only be used for predicting. The folders should be in the same project directory:
````csharp
            // Get the solution directory path
            string solutionDirectory = Directory.GetParent(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory).Parent.Parent.Parent.FullName;

            // Construct paths for training and predicting folders
            string trainingfolderPath = Path.Combine(solutionDirectory, "training_files");
            string predictingfolderPath = Path.Combine(solutionDirectory, "predicting_files");
````

After extracting data from JSON files, we have to convert it into a format suitable for HTM training.

````csharp
foreach (var sequencesContainer in sequencesContainers)
            {
                var sequences = sequencesContainer.Sequences;

                foreach (var sequence in sequences)
                {
                    List<double> convertedSequence = sequence.Select(x => (double)x).ToList();

                    string sequenceKey = "S" + sequenceIndex;
                    mysequences.Add(sequenceKey, convertedSequence);
                    sequenceIndex++;
                }

````
We use multisequencelearning class for training our HTM model like below:
````csharp
           // Train the model using MultiSequenceLearning
            MultiSequenceLearning myexperiment = new MultiSequenceLearning();
            var predictor = myexperiment.Run(mysequences);
            predictor.Reset();
````

We are going to use the predictor object as trained HTM model to predict anomalies from our extracted data from predicting_files.

Using the `AnomalyDetectMethodÂ´ method of AnomalyDetection class, we pass the numerical sequences one by one to our predictor model to detect anomalies.

````csharp
           foreach (var sequence in sequences)
                {
                    List<double> inputlist = sequence.Select(x => (double)x).ToList();
                    double[] inputArray = inputlist.ToArray();
                    AnomalyDetection.AnomalyDetectMethod(predictor, inputArray, 0.2);
                }
```` 

We are going to iterate through each value of a numerical sequence which is passed through inputarray parameter to the `AnomalyDetectMethod` method. The trained model output: predictor is used to predict the next element for comparison. We use an anomalyscore ratio to calculate and compare to detect anomalies If the prediction crosses a certain tolerance level, it is taken as an anomaly. We can pass the tolerance value from outside to the method mentioned above.

```csharp
                    var res = predictor.Predict(item);
```
The prediction derived from predictor model is in a format of "NeoCortexApi.Classifiers.ClassifierResult`1[System.String]". We use string operations to extract data from it. 

```csharp
                    var value1 = res.First().PredictedInput.ToString().Split('-');
                    var value2 = res.First().Similarity;
```

Normally output from HTM is in the following format when we pass a numerical value 14 for example:
```csharp
S3_11-5-12-10-14-13 - 100
S1_5-6-16-10-4-11-7 - 5
.....
```

The first line has the best prediction which HTM model predicts with accuracy. We can easily derive the predicted value which will come after 14 (in this case, it is 13). The string operations are used to get these values. Later we are going to use this to determine anomalies.

````csharp

                ..............

                        int nextIndex = i + 1;
                        double nextItem = list[nextIndex];
                        double predictedNextItem = double.Parse(value1.Last());
                        var AnomalyScore = Math.Abs(predictedNextItem - nextItem);
                        var deviation = AnomalyScore / nextItem;

                ..........
````

We are using AnomalyScore, which is nothing but the absolute value of the ration of differences of HTMÂ´s predicted number and actual number. If the ratio exceeds tolerancevalue, we mark it as anomaly, otherwise it is not. When an anomaly is detected, we are going to skip that element in the list(we are not going to pass that value to HTM in loop).
